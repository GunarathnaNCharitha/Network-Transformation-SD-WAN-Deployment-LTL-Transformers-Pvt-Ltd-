## Project Overview
As Lead Engineer, I directed the **end-to-end redesign of the enterprise network** for **LTL Transformers (Pvt) Ltd**, covering HQ and multiple branch/factory sites.  

The initiative replaced legacy systems with **FortiGate NGFWs, SD-WAN, BGP-based redundant VPNs, and Azure integration**, ensuring secure, resilient, and future-proof connectivity across the group.  

---

## Business Challenges
- Legacy WAN with **single points of failure** and limited scalability.  
- Lack of **resilient VPN connectivity** between sites and HQ.  
- Inconsistent management of firewalls across multiple branches.  
- Growing need to support **cloud workloads in Azure**.  
- Poor visibility into traffic and branch security posture.  

---

## Solution Implemented
A **modernized hybrid WAN and security architecture** was deployed:  
- **FortiGate NGFW clusters** installed at HQ and factories for redundancy.  
- **SD-WAN overlay** for intelligent application-aware path selection.  
- **BGP-based dynamic routing** for redundant site-to-site VPN tunnels.  
- **Azure integration** for seamless cloud/on-premises access.  
- **Centralized firewall management** for all group sites.  
- Redesigned the LAN/WAN with **segmentation and high availability**.  

---

## Outcomes & Benefits
- **Resilient VPN architecture** with BGP dynamic failover.  
- **Unified firewall deployments** across all group sites.  
- **Hybrid WAN** with SD-WAN optimization for cloud and on-prem apps.  
- **Enhanced monitoring and visibility** across the enterprise.  
- **Future-ready design** supporting new technologies and business growth.  

---

## My Key Contributions
- Designed the **new WAN architecture** with BGP and SD-WAN.  
- Implemented **redundant VPN tunnels** with dynamic routing.  
- Deployed and managed **FortiGate NGFW clusters** across HQ and branches.  
- Integrated **Azure cloud workloads** with secure connectivity.  
- Standardized **security policies and segmentation** group-wide.  
- Directed the **cutover and migration plan**, ensuring minimal downtime.
